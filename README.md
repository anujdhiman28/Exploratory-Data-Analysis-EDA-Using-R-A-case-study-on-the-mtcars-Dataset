# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Using-R-A-case-study-on-the-mtcars-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in data analysis that helps analysts understand the structure, patterns, relationships, and characteristics of a dataset. EDA can be visual and quantitative, often using graphs, summary statistics, and tables to discover insights about the data. In this report, we perform an exploratory data analysis on the mtcars dataset, which is available in R by default. The mtcars dataset contains various attributes of different car models from the 1970s, including miles per gallon (mpg), number of cylinders (cyl), horsepower (hp), and more.
This report covers the following steps:
1.	Installation of R and Required Packages.
2.	Downloading the dataset and exploring its dimensions.
3.	Applying arithmetic operations and mathematical functions.
4.	Data frame creation and manipulation.
5.	Looping in R.
6.	Creating visualizations: Histograms and Boxplots.
7.	Exploring relationships between variables.
8.	Conclusion and insights.
